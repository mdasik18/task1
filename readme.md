My Simple Responsive Landing Page
This project is a basic, clean, and responsive landing page built purely with HTML and CSS. It's designed to showcase fundamental web development concepts like semantic HTML, CSS Flexbox for layout, and media queries for responsiveness.

Project Objective
The main goal was to create a straightforward landing page that adapts well to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) .

Features
Header: Contains a brand logo and navigation links.

Hero Section: A prominent section with a catchy heading, a descriptive paragraph, and a call-to-action button.

Footer: Includes copyright information and placeholder social media links.

Responsive Design: The layout adjusts automatically for optimal viewing on various devices.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and content of the page.

CSS3: For styling, layout (using Flexbox), and responsiveness (using Media Queries).



How to Run Locally
To view this landing page on your local machine:

Clone or Download: Get the project files ( index.html and style.css) onto your computer.

Open with Live Server (Recommended):

If you're using VS Code, install the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey.

Open the project folder in VS Code.

Right-click on index.html in the Explorer panel and select "Open with Live Server".

This will open the page in your default web browser and automatically refresh it when you make changes to the code.

Open Directly: You can also simply open the index.html file directly in your web browser. However, Live Server is better for development as it provides live reloading.

Testing Responsiveness

Resize the Browser Window: Drag the edges of your browser window to make it narrower or wider. You'll see the layout change (e.g., the navigation links will stack vertically on smaller screens).

Developer Tools: Most browsers (like Chrome) have Developer Tools (usually accessed by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect"). In the Developer Tools, you can use the "Toggle device toolbar" icon (looks like a phone and tablet) to simulate different device sizes and orientations.
